		<h2>What is this</h2>
		<p>This project proposes to analyze a GitHub repository, especially on issues management:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Time analysis of opened issues.</li>
			<li>Time analysis of closed issues.</li>
			<li>Time analysis of the ratio between opened and closed issues.</li>
			<li>Enhancement of the three most active users on opening issues.</li>
			<li>Enhancement of the three most active users on closing issues.</li>
			<li>Enhancement of the number of opened and closed issues.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These aspects are represented through graphics and tables.</p>
		<p>Some information about the users is deliberately hidden: We only show the 15% of the best users in the tables in parts to avoid any competition. The only objective is mutual help and encouragement.</p>

		<h2>Why is this</h2>
		<p>We wanted to create this tool to encourage people to improve their product by the following points.</p>
		<p>We think that issues are a good measure to the activity and the progress of a project:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>People who open issues want to see bug fixes and/or new features in the product they use.</li>
			<li>People who close issues fixe bugs and/or add new features to the product they use.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We think that the number of issues opened and the number of issues closed should be very similar. This proves the activity and continuous integration of the product as people want to see new features and people implement them.</p>
